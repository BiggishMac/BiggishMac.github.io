    <h1>Happy Mother's Day</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Dear Mum,<br>Thanks so much for being an amazing person. You’d probably win happy person’s day, if it was a thing. I don’t wanna spend to much time on you being a mother, because your way more than that. And you’re a pretty crap mother. KIDDING. Horrible jokes leads pretty well into my first point – how forgiving and kind you are. No matter what idiot thing I do, you are so empathetic and always are looking out for me even when I can’t. All those people who call up to lifeline are in the best hands there are – you’re hands. Next, you are a massive inspiration – writing a book is an insane task for anyone to do, and you have to deal with ME at the same time. And dad. Hehehehe. It’s incredibly insanely indubitably impressive, and it is great for me to see you do something like this that for me seems impossible, yet you are so close to finishing (in my eyes). I also have full faith that if and when the book gets published, it will go amazingly - because you are amazing, so by irrefutable logic it will have the best launch ever. Thanks so much for being my mother. I probably can’t say thanks enough, but I will try. Love you forever, Me, Ben Mac.</p>
